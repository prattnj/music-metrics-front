# music-metrics
Web app that provides the user with in-depth Spotify listening stats.

## Elevator Pitch

You probably have listened to music once or twice. Have you ever wondered what your top songs are, or more specifically, how many times you've listened to them? This web app will not only deliver the facts and figures that you are given by Spotify, but we will expound upon those stats to really satisfy you're itch to know about your listening history. For example, we can provide top albums, total listening time for a certain time period, and the counts for every song you've explored (all things that Spotify doesn't report directly).

## What I Learned (HTML portion):

Throughout this unit, I have learned a lot more about HTML despite already knowing a decent amount. For example, I have never embedded videos in a webpage that way before. Additionally, I learned more about the various options we have for inputting information and even displaying that information, using elements like tables.

## What I Learned (CSS portion):

For years now, I have been using CSS to design websites that are more pleasing to the eye. I haven't, however, ever received any kind of formal education about any kind of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Before this unit, I thought I already knew most of what there was to know about CSS. On the contrary, I ended up learning quite a lot about various areas of CSS. I think the most I learned came from the section about transitions and animations. I was unaware of just how many options you have for that type of thing.
